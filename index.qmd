## Project Overview

This analysis examines the spatial equity of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Philadelphia, identifying service gaps and priority areas for future development. Using network analysis and socioeconomic data, I evaluate the current distribution of charging stations and develop a robust methodology to prioritize areas with the greatest need for infrastructure investment.

## Research Questions

This analysis seeks to answer the following key questions:

1. How equitably is Philadelphia's EV charging infrastructure currently distributed?
2. What demographic factors correlate with charging station access?
3. Which areas of Philadelphia have the greatest need for new charging infrastructure?
4. How can future infrastructure development better serve all communities?

## Key Findings

- **Spatial Distribution**: EV charging infrastructure is heavily concentrated in Center City and University City, with significant gaps in North and West Philadelphia
- **Demographic Patterns**: 
  - High-density areas have the lowest coverage (29.6% compared to 42.4% for low-density areas)
  - Medium-income areas have the highest coverage (49.2%), while low-income areas have the least (16.8%)
- **Gap Analysis**: 11.9% of census tracts fall into the Critical Priority category, requiring immediate attention
- **Equity Assessment**: Education level shows the strongest statistical relationship with charging access

## Methodology Highlights

The analysis employs a dynamic weighting system that responds to observed disparities:

- **Network Analysis**: Walking and driving distances calculated using OpenStreetMap network data
- **Gap Score Components**:
  - Physical Coverage (24%)
  - Income Level (16%)
  - Poverty Rate (24%)
  - Population Density (20%) 
  - Education Level (16%)
- **Service Areas**: Multi-buffer approach including walking (0.25-0.75 miles) and driving (1-3 miles) distances

## Project Structure

- **Methods**: Detailed documentation of data sources, preprocessing steps, and analytical techniques
- **Results**: Key findings across spatial, demographic, and equity dimensions
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Explore infrastructure gaps and priority areas dynamically
- **Conclusions**: Recommendations for equitable infrastructure development
