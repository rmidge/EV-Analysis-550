    "\n",
    "Even tracts that host chargers can remain in the **High** or **Critical** tiers due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equity Weights** → Our model places significant weight on socioeconomic factors (76% combined) versus pure coverage (24%), meaning areas with high poverty rates (24%) or population density (20%) receive priority regardless of physical access.\n",
    "2. **Station Clustering** → The map reveals significant station clustering in Center City and University City, while many high-priority neighborhoods have only isolated stations that cannot adequately serve the entire tract.\n",
    "3. **Quality Disparities** → Existing stations in underserved areas often have fewer charging points or lower power capacity than those in affluent areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Patterns in the EV Charging Gap Map\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive map reveals several important spatial patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Downtown Concentration** → EV charging infrastructure is heavily concentrated in Center City, with dense clusters of stations serving primarily commercial and high-income residential areas.\n",
    "2. **North-South Divide** → North and West Philadelphia show extensive areas of High and Critical priority (red), while Northeast Philadelphia generally shows lower priority needs.\n",
    "3. **Transit Corridors** → Medium priority areas (orange) often follow major transit corridors like Broad Street and Market Street, where access may be better but still insufficient given population density.\n",
    "4. **Suburban Edge Contrast** → The city's edges show a contrast between lower priority areas in the Northeast versus higher priority areas in the Northwest and Southwest, reflecting socioeconomic differences between these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Recommendation:** New station investments should target the Critical priority areas in North and West Philadelphia where high population density combines with significant socioeconomic need.\n"
